## Project Overview

This project is an IoT-based air conditioning control system developed during an internship. It allows users to monitor and control air conditioning units remotely. Using a microcontroller, such as the ESP32 or ESP8266, this system integrates seamlessly with a mobile app or web interface for real-time management. 

The goal is to enhance comfort and energy efficiency in homes. By leveraging the Internet of Things (IoT), users can adjust their AC settings from anywhere, ensuring optimal climate control.

## Features

- **Remote Control**: Manage your AC unit from anywhere using your smartphone or computer.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Get instant feedback on temperature and humidity levels.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive mobile app and web dashboard.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Optimize AC usage to save on electricity bills.
- **Notifications**: Receive alerts for maintenance and unusual activity.
- **Multi-Device Support**: Control multiple AC units from a single interface.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates various technologies to create a robust and efficient system:

- **Microcontrollers**: ESP32, ESP8266
- **Programming Languages**: Arduino, Python
- **Communication Protocol**: MQTT
- **Web Framework**: Vercel
- **Dashboard**: Custom-built for easy access
- **Home Automation**: Integration with existing smart home systems

## How It Works

The system operates using the following components:

1. **Microcontroller**: The ESP32/ESP8266 collects data from the AC unit and sends it to the cloud.
2. **MQTT Protocol**: This lightweight messaging protocol facilitates communication between the microcontroller and the app.
3. **Mobile/Web Interface**: Users interact with the system through these interfaces, sending commands to the microcontroller.

### Data Flow

- The microcontroller reads temperature and humidity data from the AC unit.
- It publishes this data to the MQTT broker.
- The mobile app subscribes to this data and displays it in real-time.
